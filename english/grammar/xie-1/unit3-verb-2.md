# Unit 3 - be 动词和一般动词的过去时

## be 动词的过去时

- am / is --> was
- are --> were

过去时 be 动词表示 "过去时间中发生的状态"。

- He is busy now.
- He was busy then. (then: 那个时候)

now 和 then，表示时间，归在副词一类。

时间副词改变，动词也必须跟着改变。动词会随着时间改变而改变形态，这就是时态。

be 动词的过去时还有一层含义，过去的状态，现在已经不存在了。

- I was a student. (also means I am not a student now.)

### be 动词过去时的否定句

句型：主词 + was / were + not

- Mr Brown was a vet. (vet: 兽医。布朗先生以前是兽医，现在不是了)
- Mr Brown was not a vet. (布朗先生以前不是兽医，现在是了)

### be 动词过去时的疑问句 (一般疑问句)

句型：Was / Were + 主词 + ~ ?

回答：

例：

- Q: Were you a pianist?
- A: Yes, I was. / No, I wasn't.
